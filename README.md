## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science student with hands-on experience across **software development, systems programming, and backend web infrastructure**. I enjoy working close to the metal when needed, but I am equally comfortable building full-stack tools and data-driven applications.

I focus on writing **clean, reliable, and performant code**, and I value strong documentation and testing. My background includes Linux system administration, virtualization, containerization, database-backed applications, and backend API development. I also hold an active **DoD Secret Security Clearance**, and I am actively seeking **software engineering, systems, or cybersecurity internships**.
